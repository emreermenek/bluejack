# SE115 PROJECT - BLUEJACK (Software Engineering 1. class 1. semester project) 

## Abstract: 

I developed a game named bluejack based on spesific instruction sets which provided by SE115 lesson’s teachers. I have developed it using Java programming language and Visual Studio Code IDE. When I start writing the code, I really struggled about understanding game flow and computer logic but after I argued with my friends about it, lots of thinking and trying, I found out solutions to the problems. In these way, I developed better understanding of java language and I did my best to achieve it. It may not be working perfect but I tried my best. 

## Introduction: 

Bluejack is playable by 2 players who are computer and user itself. Game flow moving forward by looking total values of if players hands, choices that user and computer make and total win value. But most importantly when total value player equal to 20 and if player hand just contains blue cards, then it is called bluejack and player instantly win the game. That’s why game name is called as bluejack. 

## Problem Statement: 

Problem was to write it without using ArrayList methods and any GUI librarys. Due to that Game Flow should contain bunch of loops and constantly check values and wrote them when values updated. 

## Design and Methodology: 

I thought my design should be perfect for able to achieving flawless gameplay experience. My method was to use bunch of while loops to control game flow but even it seems perfect at design it did not work perfectly when I wrote the code. In the process, my design developed by enhancing my skills. 

## Implementation: 

I created methods to create and shuffle game deck. I created methods to create player cards. I created methods that changing  values by looking game flow. I wrote game flow with bunch of values and loops that controls game loop. 

## Challanges that I faced: 

1. When I first started I did not know that I can create array with a object I 		 created, I learned accidently while looking a blackjack code on github.  

2. My while loops was not working fine, after bunch of trying and searching solution on github, stack overflow and via web. I was able to write good game loop but problems did not end there. 

3. While we are not allowed use ArrayList methods I had to write my own methods to manipulate values. But, I must be honest for some methods that I write I needed to search methods via web and adapt those methods to my code . 

4. After all coding, testing and debugging still I faced with lots of problem in game flow due to poor design choices. 

5. Biggest mistake I did lack of understanding game language or understanding it wrongly and to be honest still I am not sure about I wrote exactly correct game logic. 

6. Another problem that I faced was using Scanner with loops. I did my best to prevent errors with try catch methods and more while loops but still there are some errors when user enter unwanted values. 

7. Another problem was when my code getting longer and longer, it started to be barely understandable and developable. I did my best to overcome it by using value names as clear as possible.
